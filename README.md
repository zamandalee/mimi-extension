## Abstract

MiMi is a server-optional password manager designed to create and manage encrypted passwords for user authentication in the Google Chrome browser. This Chrome Extension caters to users who prioritize security, simplicity, and convenience in safeguarding their online accounts. MiMi offers robust protection against common password attacks, such as brute force and credential stuffing, as well as targeted attacks from malicious adversaries.

## 1. Introduction

In today's digital age, web applications require user authentication, making password management a common concern for internet users. Despite the availability of password management tools and security features like two-factor authentication, traditional password managers often rely on server and database storage, leaving them vulnerable to breaches.

MiMi, a Google Chrome Extension, offers an unconventional approach to password management, where the server component is entirely optional. MiMi addresses three key user needs:

1. **Security and Mistrust:** Users are apprehensive about entrusting their authentication data to third-party services, given the risk of server or database breaches.

2. **Simplicity:** Users are wary of complex password generation and storage models, preferring straightforward solutions.

3. **Convenience:** In a world where user authentication is ubiquitous, passwords must be easily accessible.

### Security and Mistrust

A significant percentage of users express mistrust towards password management services, citing concerns about the security of their accounts. MiMi mitigates these concerns by minimizing the storage of sensitive data and assuming a default mistrust of servers and databases. For users who opt not to use the server component, no encrypted information is stored anywhere, providing robust protection against server or database attacks.

### Simplicity

MiMi's mechanism is straightforward and comprehensible, even to non-technical users. Diagrams and explanations in the extension's FAQ tab enhance transparency, fostering user trust.

### Convenience

MiMi operates as a Google Chrome extension, easily accessible via keyboard shortcuts. Users need to remember only one master password to generate unique passwords for all their accounts, offering a high level of convenience.

## 2. Background & Related Work

Existing password management solutions, including browser-integrated digital vaults and two-factor authentication methods, often rely on server-based storage, leaving them vulnerable to breaches. Well-known password managers like LastPass and OneLogin have experienced security vulnerabilities in the past.

MiMi sets itself apart by providing a serverless, client-side password management solution that never stores user data. It generates unique passwords for each website, thereby containing the impact of data breaches to individual sites.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 User Interface

After installing the MiMi Chrome extension, users simply enter their master password and use a keyboard shortcut to generate passwords for websites. The extension's popup interface allows users to configure password options for sites with specific requirements.

### 3.2 Password Generation

MiMi generates passwords by hashing a seed string, including the user password, domain name, and client token. When using MiMi-S, a site-specific random counter token is also added to the seed string. All passwords consist of sixteen alphanumeric characters.

- **User Password:** Entered by the user for password generation.
- **Domain Name:** The website's domain name (excluding subdomains and protocols).
- **Client Token:** A unique string generated upon MiMi installation, used as an essential ingredient in the hashing function.
- **Random Counter Token (MiMi-S):** A random 32-bit integer generated for site-specific password security.

### 3.3 Cross-Device Generation

MiMi supports multi-device password access through QR code-based account linking. Users scan a QR code generated by their source device on their destination device, facilitating password access across multiple devices.

### 3.4 MiMi-S

MiMi-S adds a server-database component to MiMi, enhancing security guarantees. It allows users to change passwords for sites while retaining their original user password.

MiMi-S employs secret sharing to distribute the random counter token across multiple server-database entities. This approach ensures that an attacker must compromise multiple entities to reconstruct the true random counter token, enhancing security.

## 4. Threat Model

### 4.1 Common Password Attacks

MiMi offers robust protection against common password attacks, including brute force, keyloggers, phishing, and data breaches. Unique, randomly generated passwords and domain-based hashing enhance security against these threats.

### 4.2 Targeted Password Attacks

In scenarios where attackers target specific MiMi users, MiMi's security depends on whether the server component (MiMi-S) is enabled:

- **MiMi:** Without the server component, MiMi relies on user password complexity and the client token for security. It is vulnerable to brute force attacks if the user password is weak.

- **MiMi-S:** MiMi-S provides additional security by tracking and limiting failed password generation attempts on the server. Secret sharing and distributed server-database entities enhance resilience against attacks.

## 5. Implementation

MiMi's Chrome Extension is built using JavaScript and React, bundled with Webpack. Firestore and Firebase Functions are employed for server functionality. The BLAKE2b hashing function ensures strong password generation, balancing security and efficiency.
